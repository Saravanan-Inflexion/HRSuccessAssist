==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "entities": {
      "type": "array",

==========LLM call for step "extractEntitiesProperties":==========
You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:
- entity "Ticket" (with to-many associations to "Resolution" and to-one association to "Employee" and "HRBusinessPartner")
- entity "Employee" (with to-many associations to "Ticket")
- entity "HRBusinessPartner" (with to-many associations to "Ticket")
- entity "Resolution" (with to-one association to "Ticket")

Your task is to find the properties for each entity.
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: Ticket, Property: status, Values: Open, Close
Entity: Ticket, Property: priority, Values: Very High, High, Medium, Low

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "Employee" - Properties:
    employeeID: String(50), Unique identifier for the employee
    name: String(50), Name of the employee

Entity "HRBusinessPartner" - Properties:
    hRBusinessPartnerID: String(50), Unique identifier for the HR Business Partner
    name: String(50), Name of the HR Business Partner

Entity "Ticket" - Properties:
    ticketID: String(50), Unique identifier for the ticket
    title: String(50), Title of the ticket
    description: String, Description of the ticket
    status: String(20), Status of the ticket. Allowed values: Open, Close
    priority: String(20), Priority of the ticket. Allowed values: Very High, High, Medium, Low
    employee_employeeID: String(50), employeeID of associated Employee
    businessPartner_hRBusinessPartnerID: String(50), hRBusinessPartnerID of associated HRBusinessPartner

Entity "Resolution" - Properties:
    resolutionID: String(50), Unique identifier for the resolution
    ticket_ticketID: String(50), ticketID of associated Ticket

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"Employee.csv":"employeeID;name","HRBusinessPartner.csv":"hRBusinessPartnerID;name","Ticket.csv":"ticketID;title;description;status;priority;employee_employeeID;businessPartner_hRBusinessPartnerID","Resolution.csv":"resolutionID;ticket_ticketID"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- status (of Ticket): Open, Close
- priority (of Ticket): VeryHigh, High, Medium, Low

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
```json
